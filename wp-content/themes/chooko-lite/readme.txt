== ABOUT CHOOKO LITE ==

Chooko Lite is a sweet, colorful and responsive theme for WordPress. Perfect for personal, fashion, beauty or cooking oriented blogs and creative websites.
It features two widgetizable areas (sidebar and optional footer).

Chooko Lite is the lite version of Chooko Pro, which comes with many additional features and access to premium class pro support forum and can be found at https://www.iceablethemes.com

== GETTING STARTED ==

Once you activate the theme from your WordPress admin panel, you can visit the "Theme Options" page to quickly and easily upload your own logo and optionally set a custom favicon.
If you will be using a custom header image, you can also optionally choose to enable or disable it on your homepage, blog index pages, single post pages and individual pages.
It is highly recommended to set a menu (in appearance > menu) instead of relying on the default fallback menu. Doing so will automatically activate the dropdown version of your menu in responsive mode.

Additional documentation and free support forums can be found at https://www.iceablethemes.com under "support".

== SPECIAL FEATURES INSTRUCTIONS ==

* Footer widgets: The widgetizable footer is disabled by default. To activate it, simply go to Appearance > Widgets and drop some widgets in the "Footer" area, just like you would do for the sidebar. It is recommended to use 4 widgets in the footer, or no widgets at all to disable it.
